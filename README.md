# Hools
A Match Day tracking website developed using the MERN stack model.

## Backend
To run the backend simply execute the following commands
```
npm init
cd ./backend 
node server.js
```
or 
```
cd ./backend 
node run
```
Backed is seperated into three folders
1. Controllers
In controllers we define all funcions that the API will support
2. Models
In models we define the general structure of the specific entity
3. Routes
In routes we define the actual paths 

## Frontend
To run the front end interface execute the following 
```
npm install -g lite-server
cd .\frontend
lite-server
```
